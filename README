RRB Vector implmentation

A implementation of a Persistent Vector. A Persistent Vector is an immutable Datastructure that has fast random access and fast insertion at the end.

A RRB Vector is an immutable Datastructure that has fast random access and fast insertion at the end, plus fast spliting and joining (meaning reasonably fast random insertions).

Random Accsess: O(log32(n)) 
Insertion: O(log32(n))
Split & Join: O(log(n))


For most practical perposes O(log32(n)) is constant.


My objectives:
- Learn Dylan (polymorthic collection implmentations)
- Give Dylan a better Collections library (specially for the multithreaded world and functional programming)

My implmentation is directly from the paper, with no working code as a example.

The Paper can be found in this Reposotory.
